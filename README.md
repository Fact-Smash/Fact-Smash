While taking classes, I have developed a <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Tower-Defense>tower defense game inspired by Dungeon Defender's Summoner character and Kingdom Rush</a>

I also developed a <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Better-Chess>virtual board game inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster's Colosseum</a>

In the second semester of my junior year at university, I developed a two player co-op stealth puzzle game with a group of 1 other major contributor and minor assistance from two others (sound effect development and implementation) named <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Broken-Night>Broken Night</a>
