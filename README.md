My name is Quentin Davidson. I am a prospective Game Developer finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science (Game Development Focus) at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina.

## Game Development Experience:
In my senior year of highschool, I developed a 1st person stealth game named <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Ghost-Bow>Ghost Bow</a>

While taking classes, I have developed a <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Tower-Defense>tower defense game inspired by Dungeon Defender's Summoner character and Kingdom Rush</a>

I also developed a <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Better-Chess>virtual board game inspired by Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster's Colosseum</a>

In the second semester of my junior year at university, I developed a two player co-op stealth puzzle game with a group of 1 other person and a minor assistance from two others (sound effect development and implementation) named <a href=https://github.com/Fact-Smash/Broken-Night>Broken Night</a>
